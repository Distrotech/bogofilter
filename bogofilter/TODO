			bogofilter TODO list

**** Perhaps implement helper to resize the BerkeleyDB environment.

**** Implement Concurrent Data store, quite similar to Transactional.

**** Make sure that RFC-2047 decoder runs only once, not recursively.

**** New Feature: Token aging. Support for struct data in the wordlists is
already present.

**** Two deletes for kmail?  This wouldn't be a patch for bogofilter
itself, but a change to give kmail delete-as-spam and delete-as-
nonspam buttons.  Similarly for other MUAs.

**** New Feature: Make it a milter?

**** New Feature: Multiple list file support with weights and rules. Wordlist verfification.
Eric Seppanen:
> Allow use of a variable number of list files, each with their
> own weights and rules.
> Possible uses:
> - hand-maintained "whitelist" or "blacklist" files, with massive 
> weighting to override everything else.
> - allow users to use system-wide list files and their own files.
> 
Shared-database version based on the autodaemon code,
In the shared-database version (which doesn't yet exist) worldlist
verification to avoid attacks on posters (thanks, Barry!).
Emulate the Vipul's Razor reputation scheme for people reporting tokens?
http://razor.sourceforge.net/

**** What this software is probably heading towards is a scheme in which
there's a general notion of tagged categories (spam being one) with
cluster analysis being applied to categorize which categories a
message belongs to at above 0.9 confidence level.

**** New Feature: Web based tool for wordlist management. Allow message
registration and whitelist management. HTML Templatized for easy integration
with existing web mail systems.

**** Performance Enhancement: Investigate if mmap/msync might help
performance. The db4 library does it already.

**** New Feature: Add support for a user configurable list of headers that 
should be used to ignore (single or multi-line) headers that appear in the 
list. The list should be used to ignore headers both during the message 
registration and evaluation procedures.
