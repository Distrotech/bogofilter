  (program, datastore, and database) with a clean interface
  between them.

0.14.3	2003-08-05

* Documentation updates.
* %g formatting is now supported by bogofilter's formatting functions.
* Merged trio 1.10 (http://ctrio.sourceforge.net/) to support
  compilation on ancient systems (Solaris 2.5) that do not have
  [v]snprintf functions.
  Trio is Copyright (C) 1998-2000 Bjorn Reese and Daniel Stenberg.

  "combined wordlist" feature in 0.14.0. There has been a buffer
  overflow. All users of bogofilter with combined wordlist prior to
  0.14.2 are advised to upgrade.
