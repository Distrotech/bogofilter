	* Revise mime processing to cure "fatal flex scanner internal
	  error--end of buffer missed".
	* Restore parsing rule for ending a "loose" html comment.

	2003-08-26

	* Change mime boundary line to operate on raw input,
	  i.e. before decoding it.
	* Add charset map for windows-1251 to KOI8-R (Cyrillic).

	2003-08-24

	* Fix some printf calls for 64-bit machines (%*s).
	* Fix compilation with TDB.
	* The -b and -B options now autodetect Maildir/s and iterate over each
	  mail in them. When the named input is a file, it is assumed to be a
	  single mail unless -s, -S, -n, -N or -M is given - in that case it's
	  an mbox.
	* Revised message reader implementation so the way of specifing the
	  input is independent from the input format (such as mbox vs.
	  Maildir).
	* Bugfixed Maildir implementation to read cur/ and new/.
	* Implement support for MH directory (such as used by Sylpheed).

	2003-08-23

	* Implemented new message reading protocol for processing
	  bulk mode, splitting mailboxes into messages, reading
	  messages in maildirs, etc.
