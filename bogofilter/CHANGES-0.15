	2003-09-06

	* Header line unfolding now handled by flex rules.
	  Special thanks to Michael O'Reilly for his help!
	* Initial release of RISC-OS support, including qdbm and tdb.
	* QDBM is now supported.
	* The data base configuration has changed. --with-tdb is gone,
	  use --with-database=db, --with-database=tdb or
	  --with-database=qdbm instead.

	2003-09-05

	* Update bogowordfreq to work with bogoreader.
	* Fatal flex errors are now caught and bogofilter exits
          gracefully after closing its database(s).

0.15.1	2003-09-03

	* Limit size of unfolded header lines.

	2003-09-02

	* Check for xmlto during configuration.
	* Fix problem in empty line parsing rule.
	* Fix string termination problem for bulk mode paths.

	2003-09-01

	* Allow -I to be used with file or directory.
	* Revise flex rule for encoded text to reduce program size.

	2003-08-31

	* Revise flex grammar:
	  - to reduce size of generated rules
	  - to simplify handling of header tags and mime parts

	2003-08-30

	* Clean-up message header processing:
	  - Don't tokenize message separator lines.
	  - Merge whitespace separated encoded words.
	  - Unfold header lines.

0.15.0	2003-08-30

	* Fix defective printing in 'bogofilter -Q' output.

	2003-08-28

	* Revise mime processing to cure "fatal flex scanner internal
	  error--end of buffer missed".
	* Restore parsing rule for ending a "loose" html comment.

	2003-08-26

	* Change mime boundary line to operate on raw input,
	  i.e. before decoding it.
	* Add charset map for windows-1251 to KOI8-R (Cyrillic).

	2003-08-24

	* Fix some printf calls for 64-bit machines (%*s).
	* Fix compilation with TDB.
	* The -b and -B options now autodetect Maildir/s and iterate over each
	  mail in them. When the named input is a file, it is assumed to be a
	  single mail unless -s, -S, -n, -N or -M is given - in that case it's
	  an mbox.
	* Revised message reader implementation so the way of specifing the
	  input is independent from the input format (such as mbox vs.
	  Maildir).
	* Bugfixed Maildir implementation to read cur/ and new/.
	* Implement support for MH directory (such as used by Sylpheed).

	2003-08-23

	* Implemented new message reading protocol for processing
	  bulk mode, splitting mailboxes into messages, reading
	  messages in maildirs, etc.
