	* The test suite ("make check") now works without procmail for t.MH and
	  t.maildir.

	* Minor revisions to the FAQ.
	* Miscellaneous cleanups to bogotune.c
	* Cleanup bogoutil's help message.

	2003-11-20

	* Fixed a defect in lexer.c that was discarding X-Bogosity
          lines in rfc822 attachments.  Thanks to Martin Gagern for
          reporting the problem and supplying a patch.
	* Fixed a memory leak in bogoutil.  Thanks to Dan Deward for
          reporting the problem.
	* Refactored passthrough.c.
	* Test suite bugfixes for TDB/QDBM.

	* Exclude apostrophes and backticks at the end of a token.
	* Updated bogominitrain.pl to v1.4.2
	* BerkeleyDB support warns if data base size approaches file size
	  resource limit, to avoid DB corruption when bogofilter is spawned
	  from Postfix-controlled systems (Postfix by default limits file
	  size to 51,200,000 bytes).

	2003-11-15

	* "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC...>" is now recognized as starting
          html text.

	2003-11-14

           Source rpms and bogofilter-static rpm not affected.

0.15.5.1 2003-09-30

	 * Added GSL-1.4 as requirement for binary rpm.
	 * Fixed up t.separate reference test and cleaned up 
	   t.degen, t.split, and t.regtest.

	2003-09-26

	* VERPs (Variable Envelope Return Paths) now have their
          sequence numbers replaced by a '#' for scoring.
	* Fixed problem that caused auto-update ("-u") to not update
          separate wordlists.
	* End-of-header code revised to ensure that passthrough ("-p")
          properly places the X-Bogosity line.

	2003-09-25

	* GNU GSL 1.4 has replaced DCDFLIB . If GSL 1.4 or newer is
	  installed in your system, bogofilter will use that (which will
	  usually be a shared library); if GSL is missing or a prior
	  version is present, bogofilter will statically link against GSL 1.4
	  excerpts from the gsl/ directory.

	  While we believe we have been allowed to include DCDFLIB with
	  bogofilter, some people had expressed concerns. GSL is subject
	  to the GNU General Public License v2, so we are DEFINITELY
	  allowed to include it.

	2003-09-22

	* Added support for OS/2's file system.

	* Added regression test for maintenance mode.

	  --with-database=qdbm instead.

	2003-09-05

	* Update bogowordfreq to work with bogoreader.
	* Fatal flex errors are now caught and bogofilter exits
          gracefully after closing its database(s).

0.15.1	2003-09-03

	* Limit size of unfolded header lines.

	2003-09-02

	2003-08-30

	* Fix defective printing in 'bogofilter -Q' output.

	2003-08-28

	  error--end of buffer missed".
	* Restore parsing rule for ending a "loose" html comment.

	2003-08-26

	* Change mime boundary line to operate on raw input,
	  i.e. before decoding it.
	* Add charset map for windows-1251 to KOI8-R (Cyrillic).

	2003-08-24

	* Fix some printf calls for 64-bit machines (%*s).
	* Fix compilation with TDB.
	* The -b and -B options now autodetect Maildir/s and iterate over each
	  mail in them. When the named input is a file, it is assumed to be a
	  single mail unless -s, -S, -n, -N or -M is given - in that case it's
	  an mbox.
	* Revised message reader implementation so the way of specifing the
	  input is independent from the input format (such as mbox vs.
	  Maildir).
	* Bugfixed Maildir implementation to read cur/ and new/.
	* Implement support for MH directory (such as used by Sylpheed).

	2003-08-23

	* Implemented new message reading protocol for processing
	  bulk mode, splitting mailboxes into messages, reading
	  messages in maildirs, etc.
