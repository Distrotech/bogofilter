		bogofilter -- fast Bayesian spam filtering

This package implements a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested 
by Paul Graham in his article "A Plan For Spam".  The Judy library requirement has been
dropped in favor of a built-in hash table.

This version substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing smarter
lexical analysis.  In particular, hostames and IP addresses are retained
as recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA 
cruft such as dates and message-IDs are discarded so as not to bloat
the word lists.

If you use mutt, adding the following macros to your .muttrc may be helpful:

macro index d "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<pipe-entry>bogofilter -n\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<delete-message>"
macro index \ed "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<pipe-entry>bogofilter -s\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<delete-message>"
