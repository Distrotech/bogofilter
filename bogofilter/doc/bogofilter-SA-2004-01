1. Background

Bogofilter is a software package to determine if a mail is spam or not.
It uses a data base to store words and must be trained which mails are
spam or non-spam, it looks at the probabilities of individual words.

Bogofilter understands enough of MIME to decode headers and only
consider text parts of mails.

2. Problem description

Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho provided Debian with a test case that crashed
bogofilter 0.92.7. The problem was examined and tracked down to a change
in bogofilter's quoted-printable decoder that went into 0.17.4.

The pertinent change allowed the quoted-printable decoder to accept LF
in encoded words but replaced these by NUL characters, which the calling
function inside bogofilter could not handle. It attempted to write a NUL
byte either one byte past the end of a buffer provided by the lexical
analyzer or to an address that was the negative of the address of the
first byte of the "encoded text" part of the encoded word that was
supposed to be decoded.

It was then decided to announce this as vulnerability because bogofilter
cannot process the pertinent message.

3. Impact

This vulnerability causes bogofilter to catch a "segmentation violation"
signal, which causes an immediate program abort.

The exact impact depends on the way bogofilter is integrated into the
system, in common setups, the mail that contains such irritant headers
is deferred by the mail delivery agent and remains in the queue, where
it will eventually bounce back to the sender.

4. Workaround

No reasonable workaround is known at this time.

5. Solution

Upgrade your bogofilter to version 0.92.8.

bogofilter 0.92.8 is available from sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62265&package_id=59357&release_id=277823

Note that a broken-out bugfix patch is not available at this time,
because the reversion of the failure-inducing change is not a complete
fix. Besides, bogofilter is under development and support is limited to
the latest available "current" plus the latest available "stable"
versions.
