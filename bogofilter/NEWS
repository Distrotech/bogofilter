NOTE: More information on important changes for bogofilters updaters
is in the RELEASE.NOTES files!

$Id$

	 2003-10-01

	 * Bogofilter can now use GSL 1.0 to 1.3 as well as 1.4.
	   If your distribution splits GSL into a library and a developer
	   package (Mandrake and Debian Linux), remember to install both!

0.15.5.2 2003-10-01

	 * Rebuild of i586.rpm with GSL-1.4 dynamically linked.
           Source rpms and bogofilter-static rpm not affected.

0.15.5.1 2003-09-30

	 * Added GSL-1.4 as requirement for binary rpm.
	 * Fixed up t.separate reference test and cleaned up 
	   t.degen, t.split, and t.regtest.
	 * Man page and French FAQ revised.

0.15.5	2003-09-29

	* Added '-H' (header-degen) option to aid transition to new
	  parsing.  See RELEASE.NOTES-0.15 for more info.

	2003-09-28

	* Minor revisions of OS/2 and RISC-OS compatibility code.

	2003-09-27

	* Transaction code added for wordlist maintenance.
	* Timestamp code refactored and moved from maint.c to datastore.c

	2003-09-26

	* VERPs (Variable Envelope Return Paths) now have their
          sequence numbers replaced by a '#' for scoring.
	* Fixed problem that caused auto-update ("-u") to not update
          separate wordlists.
	* End-of-header code revised to ensure that passthrough ("-p")
          properly places the X-Bogosity line.

	2003-09-25

	* GNU GSL 1.4 has replaced DCDFLIB. If GSL 1.4 or newer is
	  installed in your system, bogofilter will use that (which will
	  usually be a shared library); if GSL is missing or a prior
	  version is present, bogofilter will statically link against GSL 1.4
	  excerpts from the gsl/ directory.

 	  While we believe we have been allowed to include DCDFLIB with
	  bogofilter, some people had expressed concerns. GSL is subject
	  to the GNU General Public License v2, so we are DEFINITELY
	  allowed to include it.

	2003-09-22

	* Added support for OS/2's file system.

	2003-09-21

	* Fixed logging behavior when scoring mailboxes, maildirs, etc.

	2003-09-11

	* Use GSL (the Gnu Scientific Library) when it's available.

0.15.3	2003-09-10

	2003-09-09

	* Fixed maintenance mode (broken during database API rewrite).
	* Added regression test for maintenance mode.

          in src/tests/outputs.

	2003-09-08

	* Revised parsing to discard additional headers, i.e.
          Resent-Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References.

	  --with-database=qdbm instead.

	2003-09-05

	* Update bogowordfreq to work with bogoreader.
	* Fatal flex errors are now caught and bogofilter exits
          gracefully after closing its database(s).

0.15.1	2003-09-03

	2003-08-24

	* Fix some printf calls for 64-bit machines (%*s).
	* Fix compilation with TDB.
	* The -b and -B options now autodetect Maildir/s and iterate over each
	  mail in them. When the named input is a file, it is assumed to be a
	  single mail unless -s, -S, -n, -N or -M is given - in that case it's
	  an mbox.
	* Revised message reader implementation so the way of specifing the
	  input is independent from the input format (such as mbox vs.
	  Maildir).
	* Bugfixed Maildir implementation to read cur/ and new/.
	* Implement support for MH directory (such as used by Sylpheed).

	2003-08-23

0.10.0	2003-01-19

	* Added mime processing capability, with decoding of base64,
	  quoted-printable and uuencoded sections.  Ignores attachments when
	  computing spamicity.
	* Added wordlist maintenance capability to bogoutil.  Can discard
	  tokens based on count, age, or length.  Can replace non-ASCII chars
	  with question marks.
	* Added dates to wordlist tokens.  Option "datestamp_tokens=true|false"
	  can be used to enable/disable them.
	* Moved most documentation files to doc directory.
	* Added sample procmail file, contrib/procmailrc.example
	* Spamicity score now computable from multiple word list pairs, i.e. all
	  spam and ham word lists in directories named on command line or in
	  config file (via "wordlist=" or "bogofilter_dir=" lines).
	* Lexer is now case insensitive
	* Increase MAXTOKENLEN from 20 to 30, allowing more and longer tokens
	  to be processed.
	* New options for setting of default charset and replacing of non-ASCII
	  characters.	New character set handling routines to provide charset 
	  specific token parsing.
	* New error handling routine will output error messages to stderr and,
	  if '-l' (logging) is enabled, to syslog.
	* New message formatting capability allows formats to be put in config
	  file for X-Bogosity line and logging messages.  Message content can
	  include status, spamicity, version, etc.
	* Long-standing locking bugs that caused corruption in the database
	  have been resolved.
	* Work around ash-0.2 and bash-1 bugs, needed for make check.
	* Cater for malloc/calloc implementations that return NULL when 0 bytes
	  of memory are requested, some AIX versions e. g., that would
	  previously falsely claim an "out of memory" condition.
	  (also available as patch for 0.9.1.2)
	* Reorder gcc __attribute__ lines for gcc-2.7 compatibility.
	  (also available as patch for 0.9.1.2)

0.9.1.2	2002-12-05

	* A defect in the collect_words routines (in 0.9.1) caused
	  incorrect generation of "must get only one message to
	  calculate spamicity!" messages.  This has been fixed.
	* A defect in the contrib/bogopass script caused the unbase64-edited
	  version of the mail to be printed rather than the original with just
	  the header added. This has been fixed.
	* Documentation has been revised and updated.
	* Robinson-Fisher method now produces a tristate status, i.e.
	  spam/ham/unsure, if ham_cutoff is non-zero.  ham_cutoff defaults to
	  0.1 and can be set via config file.
	* Script contrib/bogopass has revised error and environment checking.

0.9.1	2002-11-30

	* New script contrib/bogopass allows processing of base64
	  attachments.	This is a temporary solution until base64
	  code can be built into bogofilter.
	* New file README.Robinson describes the tunable parameters
	  for the Robinson algorithm and what to do for best performance.
	* Changed the default behavior to use the Robinson algorithm.
	* Corrected incorrect sort order when printing statistics.
	* Added support for Fisher's method of combining probabilities,
	  as optimized for this purpose by Rob W. W. Hooft, to the
	  "Robinson" algorithm.
	* The new file METHODS describes the Graham, Robinson, and Fisher
	  methods that bogofilter supports for computing spamicity.
	* New file README.dcdflib gives some info on the dcdflib free
	  library of routines for cumulative distribution functions.
	* A new '-f' option tells bogofilter to use Fisher's method.
	* A new '-c' option in bogofilter allows specification of the
	  configuration file to read.
	* A new '-C' option tells bogofilter not to read any config file.
	* The syslog facility in '-l' mode has changed from "daemon" to "mail",
	  so your logs may now be in /var/log/maillog or /var/log/mail rather
	  than /var/log/messages. Check your /etc/syslog.conf.
	* The testing framework now works on Solaris.

	Internal Changes:
	* Fixed several portability problems uncovered by the new
	  regression tests.
	* Added three more regression tests designed to confirm that
	  bogofilter's results are matching saved reference results.
	* Implemented an object oriented API for using computational methods.
	* Split the main module into a registration module and three algorithm
	  modules - for the fisher, graham and robinson methods.
	* Registering big mbox files is much faster now, at the expense of some
	  memory.

0.8.0	2002-11-10

	* The lexer code now detects read errors (and exits with code 2
	  if it finds one.)
	* Fixed passthrough mode in bogofilter: it no longer strips the
	  spam-header from a mail body.
	* Fixed portability to some systems, notably, Solaris
	  and HP-UX, added README. for some systems to describe build
	  issues. 
	* Fixed "rpl_malloc" link failures.
	* Fixed bogofilter 0.7.6 passthrough regression on some
	  systems: The X-Bogofilter header would be added to the body
	  and a bogus blank line would be added.
	* Bogofilter now supports a configuration file named
	  /etc/bogofilter.cf and/or ~/.bogofilter.cf.
	* Bogofilter's use of '-v' for printing spamicity statistics
	  has been organized with increasing levels of details as
	  additional '-v's are added.
	* When using the Robinson algorithm, bogofilter can print a
	  simple histogram showing word probability distribution.
	* Bogoutil supports a new '-w' switch for displaying tokens
	  from the word list databases.
	* Bogolexer added to distribution.  Provides easy access to
	  parsing a file to examine the tokens.
	* Bogolexer has a new '-p' (passthrough) for printing tokens and
	  bogoutil has a new '-p' (probability) for printing the
	  probabilities of one or more tokens.	They can be connected
	  via pipe to display the probabilities of all words in a message.
	* DB 4.1 support has been fixed.
	* Documentation updates.

0.7.6	2002-10-27

	* Added README.hp-ux for those using HP-UX.
	* Added support for additional architectures - ia64, arm,
	  powerpc, and s390.
	* Bogofilter -p mode now preserves CR and NUL characters.
	* Bogofilter -p mode now detects if the computer runs out of
	  memory.
	* Bogofilter supports a new "-l" switch to write run-time log
	  information to syslog.
	* Bogofilter supports a new algorithm to calculate the
	  "spamicity", the "Robinson" algorithm. It is enabled with the
	  new "-r" switch. The old behavior is called the "Graham"
	  algorithm and can be enforced with the new "-g" switch.  The
	  default behavior is to use the "Graham" algorithm.
	* Bogofilter now has an "-R FILE" option (that implies -r) to print
	  an R data frame to FILE.
	* Bogofilter and bogoutil now have a "-x CLASSES" option to turn
	  on debugging.
	* Bogoupgrade.pl has been renamed to bogoupgrade.
	* There is now a man page for bogoupgrade.
	* BASE64 treatment has been fixed. It ignored whole lines if
	  they consisted of a single token. Now a token is only
	  considered base64 and ignored if it's >= 32 characters or ends
	  in one or two padding "=" signs.
	* MIME boundary lines are now emitted as tokens. Some of them
	  are typical of certain spam software, so they might turn out
	  to be useful.
	* All control characters are now considered token delimiters.
	* Bogofilter now aborts if it cannot figure where to look for its
	  database directory.
	* The software no longer crashes on machines that do not allow
	  for unaligned memory access (m68k; many RISC, e. g. SPARC).
	* DB 4.1 is now supported.
	* Documentation updates.

0.7.5	Sun Oct 20 17:34:35 PDT 2002

	* The header in bogofilter -p mode now defaults to X-Bogosity, but 
	  can be changed by using "./configure --enable-spam-header=name" at
	  compile time.
	* The option names -h/-H are back to -n/-N like they were in version 
	  0.6, and -h now means "help".
	* A utility has been added to help upgrade wordlists from older 
	  versions of bogofilter to the current format. See the UPGRADE file 
	  for more information.
	* Support has been added for the environment variable BOGOFILTER_DIR 
	  to control where bogofilter looks for it's wordlists.
	* Now bogofilter no longer depends on the Judy package. We now use a 
	  high performance hashing algorithm for message evaluation. The Judy 
	  package is no longer required to compile or run bogofilter.
	* Support for the -e flag, which will cause bogofilter to exit with a 
	  value of 0 regardless of the spamicity of the message. This is useful
	  when using -p mode.
	* Support for -u flag. This allows message evaluation and training to 
	  happen in the same invocation of bogofilter.
	* Extended TOKEN patterns to improve support for European languages.
	* Improved wordlist locking to prevent data corruption.
	* Added procmail recipes for example usage in the man page.
