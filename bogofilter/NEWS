-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2006-02-06

	* Flush output after writing spam header line and/or message body.
	* When database is near to maximum allowed size, allow reading
	  it and disallow writing to it.

	2006-01-30

	* Fix formatting of Rtable output when in the message header,
	  this keeps verbose passthrough modes RFC-822/2822 compliant.

	2006-01-29

	* The configure script, when checking Berkeley DB capabilities,
	  now checks for logging and transactional subsystems rather
	  than the locking subsystem that was abandoned before 1.0.0.
	  This appears a suitable workaround for configure lockups on
	  OpenBSD 3.7 macppc with db 4.2 or 4.3.

	2006-01-28

	* Only print Berkeley DB file size message once per run.

	2006-01-21

	* 1.0.1 Promoted to "Stable" status

	2006-01-02

	* Fixed --input-file and --output-file command line options.

	2006-01-01

	* Added CVE-2005 identifiers for defects described in
          doc/bogofilter-SA-2005-01

1.0.1	2006-01-01

	* New names for binary rpms:

	  bogofilter-db42 - requires shared library for DB-4.2.52
	  bogofilter-db42-static - statically linked with DB-4.2.52
	  bogofilter-sqlite3 - requires shared library for SQLite3-3.2.8
	  bogofilter-sqlite3-static - statically linked with SQLite3-3.2.8

	2005-12-30

	* The configure help texts have been revised, the IEEE checks
	  for trio have been simplified (they are no longer nested) and
	  configure.ac has been updated to quiet autoconf -Wobsolete
	  warnings. The README file now reflects the new requirements.

	2005-12-29

	* For maintainers: Add install-staticdblibs.sh, a script to
	  fetch and build static & lean BerkeleyDB 4.2.52.4 and SQLite
	  3.2.8 libraries. Modify some parts of the RPM building so that
	  the binary RPMs are built without external dependencies beyond
	  glibc 2.2. This may render "make rpm" unusable on non-Linux
	  platforms, but you should still be able to "rpmbuild -tb" from
	  the source .tar.gz file.

	2005-12-27

	* Add '-O' option to direct bogoutil output to a file.
	* Fix building of binary rpms with SQLite support.
	* Include SQLite binary rpm as standard part of "make rpm"

	2005-12-26

	* Split NEWS file into files NEWS and NEWS.0 for new (version
	  1.0 and after) and old (version 0.x.y) info

	2005-12-25

	* Capitalize variables in bogofilter.spec.in to please RH9's
          RPM 4.2 implementation.

	2005-12-18
	
	* Fix bad return code in db_loop() in datastore_sqlite.c
	  (reported by Sami Farin).

	2005-12-17
	
	* XML documentation cleanups (thanks to Nicholas Kaiser)

	2005-12-06

	* bogofilter.cf.example was updated to reflect the proper default of
	  db_log_autoremove=yes. It previously claimed the default were "off".

1.0.0	2005-11-30

	Release history prior to 1.0.0 is in file NEWS.0
