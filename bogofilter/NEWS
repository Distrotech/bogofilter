0.7.5	Sun Oct 20 17:34:35 PDT 2002

	* The header in bogofilter -p mode now defaults to X-Bogosity, but 
	  can be changed by using "./configure --enable-spam-header=name" at
	  compile time.
	* The option names -h/-H are back to -n/-N like they were in version 
	  0.6, and -h now means "help".
	* A utility has been added to help upgrade worlists from older 
	  versions of bogofilter to the current format. See the UPGRADE file 
	  for more information.
	* Support has been added for the environment variable BOGOFILTER_DIR 
	  to control where bogofilter looks for it's wordlists.
	* Now bogofilter no longer depends on the Judy package. We now use a 
	  high performance hashing algorithm for message evaluation. The Judy 
	  package is no longer required to compile or run bogofilter.
	* Support for the -e flag, which will cause bogofilter to exit with a 
	  value of 0 regardless of the spamicity of the message. This is useful
	  when using -p mode.
	* Support for -u flag. This allows messsage evaluation and training to 
	  happen in the same invocation of bogofilter.
	* Extended TOKEN patterns to impeove support for european languages.
	* Improved worlist locking to prevent data corruption.
	* Added procmail recipies for example usage in the man page.
