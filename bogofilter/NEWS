1.0.1	XXX not yet released XXX

	2005-12-29

	* For maintainers: Add install-staticdblibs.sh, a script to
	  fetch and build static & lean BerkeleyDB 4.2.52.4 and SQLite
	  3.2.8 libraries. Modify some parts of the RPM building so that
	  the binary RPMs are built without external dependencies beyond
	  glibc 2.2. This may render "make rpm" unusable on non-Linux
	  platforms, but you should still be able to "rpmbuild -tb" from
	  the source .tar.gz file.

	2005-12-27

	* Add '-O' option to direct bogoutil output to a file.
	* Fix building of binary rpms with SQLite support.
	* Include SQLite binary rpm as standard part of "make rpm"
