	* Increase MAXTOKENLEN from 20 to 30, allowing more and longer
	  tokens to be processed.

	2002-12-07
	* Using new charset handling routines to provide charset
	  specific token parsing.
	* Added new config file options for setting of default charset
	  and replacing of nonascii characters.
	* New error handling routine will output error messages to stderr
	  and, if '-l' (logging) is enabled, to syslog.
	* Work around ash-0.2 and bash-1 bugs, needed for make check.
	* Reorder gcc __attribute__ lines for gcc-2.7 compatibility.
	* Cater for malloc/calloc implementations that return NULL when 0 bytes
	  of memory are requested, some AIX versions e. g., that would
	  previously falsely claim an "out of memory" condition.

	* New message formatting capability allows formats to be put
	  in config file for X-Bogosity line and logging messages.
	  Message contant can include status, spamicity, version, etc.

0.9.1.2	2002-12-05

	* A defect in the collect_words routines (in 0.9.1) caused
	  incorrect generation of "must get only one message to
	  calculate spamicity!" messages.  This has been fixed.
	* A defect in the contrib/bogopass script caused the unbase64-edited
	  version of the mail to be printed rather than the original with just
	  the header added. This has been fixed.
	* Documentation has been revised and updated.
	* Robinson-Fisher method now produces a tristate status, i.e.
	  spam/ham/unsure, if ham_cutoff is non-zero.  ham_cutoff defaults to
	  0.1 and can be set via config file.
	* Script contrib/bogopass has revised error and environment checking.

0.9.1	2002-11-30

	* New script contrib/bogopass allows processing of base64
	  attachments.  This is a temporary solution until base64
	  code can be built into bogofilter.
	* New file README.Robinson describes the tunable parameters
	  for the Robinson algorithm and what to do for best performance.
	* Changed the default behavior to use the Robinson algorithm.
	* Corrected incorrect sort order when printing statistics.
	* Added support for Fisher's method of combining probabilities,
	  as optimized for this purpose by Rob W. W. Hooft, to the
	  "Robinson" algorithm.
	* The new file METHODS describes the Graham, Robinson, and Fisher
	  methods that bogofilter supports for computing spamicity.
	* New file README.dcdflib gives some info on the dcdflib free
	  library of routines for cumulative distribution functions.
	* A new '-f' option tells bogofilter to use Fisher's method.
	* A new '-c' option in bogofilter allows specification of the
	  configuration file to read.
	* A new '-C' option tells bogofilter not to read any config file.
	* The syslog facility in '-l' mode has changed from "daemon" to "mail",
	  so your logs may now be in /var/log/maillog or /var/log/mail rather
	  than /var/log/messages. Check your /etc/syslog.conf.
	* The testing framework now works on Solaris.

	Internal Changes:
	* Fixed several portability problems uncovered by the new
	  regression tests.
	* Added three more regression tests designed to confirm that
	  bogofilter's results are matching saved reference results.
	* Implemented an object oriented API for using computational methods.
	* Split the main module into a registration module and three algorithm
	  modules - for the fisher, graham and robinson methods.
	* Registering big mbox files is much faster now, at the expense of some
	  memory.

0.8.0	2002-11-10

	* The lexer code now detects read errors (and exits with code 2
	  if it finds one.)
	* Fixed passthrough mode in bogofilter: it no longer strips the
	  spam-header from a mail body.
	* Fixed portability to some systems, notably, Solaris
	  and HP-UX, added README. for some systems to describe build
	  issues. 
	* Fixed "rpl_malloc" link failures.
	* Fixed bogofilter 0.7.6 passthrough regression on some
	  systems: The X-Bogofilter header would be added to the body
	  and a bogus blank line would be added.
	* Bogofilter now supports a configuration file named
	  /etc/bogofilter.cf and/or ~/.bogofilter.cf.
	* Bogofilter's use of '-v' for printing spamicity statistics
	  has been organized with increasing levels of details as
	  additional '-v's are added.
	* When using the Robinson algorithm, bogofilter can print a
	  simple histogram showing word probability distribution.
	* Bogoutil supports a new '-w' switch for displaying tokens
	  from the word list databases.
	* Bogolexer added to distribution.  Provides easy access to
	  parsing a file to examine the tokens.
	* Bogolexer has a new '-p' (passthrough) for printing tokens and
	  bogoutil has a new '-p' (probability) for printing the
	  probabilities of one or more tokens.  They can be connected
	  via pipe to display the probabilities of all words in a message.
	* DB 4.1 support has been fixed.
	* Documentation updates.

0.7.6	2002-10-27

	* Added README.hp-ux for those using HP-UX.
	* Added support for additional architectures - ia64, arm,
	  powerpc, and s390.
	* Bogofilter -p mode now preserves CR and NUL characters.
	* Bogofilter -p mode now detects if the computer runs out of
	  memory.
	* Bogofilter supports a new "-l" switch to write run-time log
	  information to syslog.
	* Bogofilter supports a new algorithm to calculate the
	  "spamicity", the "Robinson" algorithm. It is enabled with the
	  new "-r" switch. The old behavior is called the "Graham"
	  algorithm and can be enforced with the new "-g" switch.  The
	  default behavior is to use the "Graham" algorithm.
	* Bogofilter now has an "-R FILE" option (that implies -r) to print
	  an R data frame to FILE.
	* Bogofilter and bogoutil now have a "-x CLASSES" option to turn
	  on debugging.
	* Bogoupgrade.pl has been renamed to bogoupgrade.
	* There is now a man page for bogoupgrade.
	* BASE64 treatment has been fixed. It ignored whole lines if
	  they consisted of a single token. Now a token is only
	  considered base64 and ignored if it's >= 32 characters or ends
	  in one or two padding "=" signs.
	* MIME boundary lines are now emitted as tokens. Some of them
	  are typical of certain spam software, so they might turn out
	  to be useful.
	* All control characters are now considered token delimiters.
	* Bogofilter now aborts if it cannot figure where to look for its
	  data base directory.
	* The software no longer crashes on machines that do not allow
	  for unaligned memory access (m68k; many RISC, e. g. SPARC).
	* DB 4.1 is now supported.
	* Documentation updates.

0.7.5	Sun Oct 20 17:34:35 PDT 2002

	* The header in bogofilter -p mode now defaults to X-Bogosity, but 
	  can be changed by using "./configure --enable-spam-header=name" at
	  compile time.
	* The option names -h/-H are back to -n/-N like they were in version 
	  0.6, and -h now means "help".
	* A utility has been added to help upgrade wordlists from older 
	  versions of bogofilter to the current format. See the UPGRADE file 
	  for more information.
	* Support has been added for the environment variable BOGOFILTER_DIR 
	  to control where bogofilter looks for it's wordlists.
	* Now bogofilter no longer depends on the Judy package. We now use a 
	  high performance hashing algorithm for message evaluation. The Judy 
	  package is no longer required to compile or run bogofilter.
	* Support for the -e flag, which will cause bogofilter to exit with a 
	  value of 0 regardless of the spamicity of the message. This is useful
	  when using -p mode.
	* Support for -u flag. This allows message evaluation and training to 
	  happen in the same invocation of bogofilter.
	* Extended TOKEN patterns to improve support for European languages.
	* Improved wordlist locking to prevent data corruption.
	* Added procmail recipes for example usage in the man page.

	* Check your scripts!  Option names have changed.
	* Name changes: goodlist -> hamlist, badlist-> spamlist.
	  This is a step towards supporting more categories.
	* Autodaemon is gone.  Instead, the new implementation uses
	  DBM.  Optimization with mmap will be in a future release.

	  change by Paul Graham.
	* Documented -d option.

0.5: Thu Aug 29 13:38:12 EDT 2002

	* Passthrough option can be used to add an X-Spam-Status header.
	* There is now a per-message word frequency cap, so spammers can't do
	  an equivalent of Google fodder.
	* HTML comments are now ignored.
	* HTML 4.0 keywords and attributes are now ignored.
	* Improved extrema calculation.
	* Mutt patch withdrawn -- have a better version of mutt macros instead.
