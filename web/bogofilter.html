In its normal mode of operation, it takes an email message or other
text on standard input, does a statistical check against lists of
"good" and "bad" words, and returns a status code indicating whether
or not the message is spam.  Bogofilter is designed with a fast
algorithm, uses the Berkeley DB for fast startup and lookups,
coded directly in C, and tuned for speed, so it can be used for
production by sites that process a lot of mail.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="theory"></a><h2>THEORY OF OPERATION</h2><p><span class="application">Bogofilter</span> treats its input as a bag
of tokens.  Each token is checked against a wordlist, which maintains
counts of the numbers of times it has occurred in non-spam and spam
mails.  These numbers are used to compute an estimate of the
probability that a message in which the token occurs is spam.  Those are
combined to indicate whether the message is spam or ham.</p><p>While this method sounds crude compared to the more usual
pattern-matching approach, it turns out to be extremely effective.
Paul Graham's paper <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html" target="_top">
A Plan For Spam</a> is recommended reading.</p><p>This program substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing
smarter lexical analysis.  <span class="application">Bogofilter</span> does
proper MIME decoding and a reasonable HTML parsing.  Special kinds of
tokens like hostnames and IP addresses are retained as recognition
features rather than broken up.  Various kinds of MTA cruft such as
dates and message-IDs are ignored so as not to bloat the wordlist.
Tokens found in various header fields are marked appropriately.</p><p>Another improvement is that this program offers Gary Robinson's
suggested modifications to the calculations (see the parameters robx
and robs below).  These modifications are described in Robinson's
paper <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101454/stories/2002/09/16/spamDetection.html" target="_top">Spam
Detection</a>.</p><p>Since then, Robinson (see his Linux Journal article <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6467" target="_top">A Statistical
Approach to the Spam Problem</a>) and others have realized that
the calculation can be further optimized using Fisher's method.</p><p>In short words this is how it works: The estimates for the spam
probabilities of the individual tokens are combined using the "inverse
chi-square function".  Its value indicates how badly the null
hypothesis that the message is just a random collection of independent
words with probabilities given by our previous estimates fails.  This
function is very sensitive to small probabilities (hammish words), but
not to high probabilities (spammish words); so the value only
indicates strong hammish signs in a message. Now using inverse
probabilities for the tokens, the same computation is done again,
giving an indicator that a message looks strongly spammish.  Finally,
those two indicators are subtracted (and scaled into a 0-1-interval).
This combined indicator (bogosity) is close to 0 if the signs for a
hammish message are stronger than for a spammish message and close to
1 if the situation is the other way round.  If signs for both are
equally strong, the value will be near 0.5.  Since those message don't
give a clear indication there is a tristate mode in
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to mark those messages as
unsure, while the clear messages are marked as spam or ham,
respectively.  In two-state mode, every message is marked as either
spam or ham.</p><p>Various parameters influence these calculations, the most
important are:</p><p>robx: the score given to a token which has not seen before.
robx is the probability that the token is spammish.</p><p>robs: a weight on robx which moves the probability of a little seen
token towards robx.</p><p>min_dev: a minimum distance from .5 for tokens to use in the
calculation.  Only tokens farther away from 0.5 than this value are
used.</p><p>spam_cutoff: messages with scores greater than or equal to will
be marked as spam.</p><p>ham_cutoff: If zero or spam_cutoff, all messages with values
strictly below spam_cutoff are marked as ham, all others as spam
(two-state).  Else values less than or equal to ham_cutoff are marked
as ham, messages with values strictly between ham_cutoff and
spam_cutoff are marked as unsure; the rest as spam (tristate)</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="options"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><p>HELP OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-h</tt> option prints the help message and exits.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-V</tt> option prints the version number and
exits.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-Q</tt> (query) option prints bogofilter's configuration,
i.e. registration parameters, parsing options, bogofilter directory, etc.</p><p>CLASSIFICATION OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-p</tt> (passthrough) option writes a copy of
the input mail to the output with an X-Bogosity header inserted.  If
the input is from a pipe or a socket, bogofilter will keep a copy of
the entire message in memory.  If the input is a file that can be
rewound, bogofilter will read it a second time.  In normal operation,
the message is piped to bogofilter, hence a copy is kept in memory.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-e</tt> (embed) option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to exit with code 0 unless there
was an error (even if the mail is not spam or classified as unsure).
This simplifies using bogofilter from procmail or maildrop.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-t</tt> (terse) option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to print an abbreviated
spamicity message containing 1 letter and the score.  Spam is
indicated with "Y", ham by "N", and unsure by "U".  Note: the
formatting can be customized using the config file.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-T</tt> provides an invariant terse mode for
scripts to use.  <span class="application">bogofilter</span> will print an
abbreviated spamicity message containing 1 letter and the score.  Spam
is indicated with "S", ham by "H", and unsure by "U".</p><p>The <tt class="option">-TT</tt> provides an invariant terse mode for
scripts to use.  <span class="application">Bogofilter</span> prints only the
score and displays it to 16 significant digits.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-u</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to register the message's text
after classifying it as spam or non-spam.  A spam message will be
registered on the spamlist and a non-spam message on the goodlist.  If
the classification is "unsure", the message will not be registered.
Effectively this option runs <span class="application">bogofilter</span>
with the <tt class="option">-s</tt> or <tt class="option">-n</tt> flag, as
appropriate.  (Caution is urged in the use of this capability, as any
classification errors <span class="application">bogofilter</span> may make
will be preserved and will accumulate until manually corrected with
the <tt class="option">-Sn</tt> and <tt class="option">-Ns</tt> option
combinations.)</p><p>The <tt class="option">-H</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to not tag tokens from the
header. This option is for testing, you should not use it in normal
operation.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-M</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to process its input as a mbox
formatted file.  If the <tt class="option">-v</tt> or <tt class="option">-t</tt>
option is also given, a spamicity line will be printed for each
message.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-b</tt> (streaming bulk mode) option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to classify multiple objects
whose names are read from stdin.  If the <tt class="option">-v</tt> or
<tt class="option">-t</tt> option is also given,
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> will print a line giving file
name and classification information for each file.  This is an alternative to 
<tt class="option">-B</tt> which lists objects on the command line.</p><p>An object in this context shall be a maildir (autodetected), or
if it's not a maildir, a single mail unless <tt class="option">-M</tt> is
given - in that case it's processed as a mbox.  (The Content-Length:
header is not taken into account currently.)</p><p>When reading mbox format, bogofilter relies on the empty line
after a mail.  If needed, formail -es will ensure this is the case.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-B <i class="replaceable"><tt>filename ...</tt></i></tt>
(bulk mode) option tells <span class="application">bogofilter</span> to
classify multiple objects named on the command line.  If the
<tt class="option">-v</tt> or <tt class="option">-t</tt> option is also given,
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> will print a line giving file
name and classification information for each file.  This is an alternative to 
<tt class="option">-b</tt> which lists objects on stdin.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-R</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to output an R data frame in
text form on the standard output.  See the section on integration with
R, below, for further detail.</p><p>REGISTRATION OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-s</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to register the text presented
as spam.  The database is created if absent.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-n</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to register the text presented
as non-spam.</p><p><span class="application">Bogofilter</span> doesn't detect if a
message registered twice.  If you do this by accident, the token
counts will off by 1 from what you really want and the corresponding
spam scores will be slightly off.  Given a large number of tokens and
messages in the wordlist, this doesn't matter.  The problem _can_ be
corrected by using the <tt class="option">-S</tt> option or the <tt class="option">-N</tt>
option.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-S</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to undo a prior registration of
the same message as spam.  If a message was incorrectly entered as
spam by '-s' or '-u' and you want to remove it and enter it as
non-spam, use options '-Sn'.  If '-S' is used for a message that
wasn't registered as spam, the counts will still be
decremented.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-N</tt> option tells
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> to undo a prior registration of
the same message as non-spam.  If a message was incorrectly entered as
non-spam by '-n' or '-u' and you want to remove it and enter it as
spam, then use '-Ns'.  If '-N' is used for a message that wasn't
registered as non-spam, the counts will still be decremented.</p><p>GENERAL OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-c <i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i></tt>
option tells <span class="application">bogofilter</span> to read the config
file named.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-C</tt> option prevents bogofilter from reading
configuration files.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-d <i class="replaceable"><tt>dir</tt></i></tt> option
allows you to set the directory for the database.  See the ENVIRONMENT
section for other directory setting options.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-k <i class="replaceable"><tt>cachesize</tt></i></tt> option
sets the cache size for the BerkeleyDB subsystem, in units of 1 MByte (1,048,576
bytes).  Properly sizing the cache improves
<span class="application">bogofilter</span>'s performance.  The recommended
size is one third of the size of the database file.  You can run the
<span class="application">bogotune</span> script (in the tuning directory) to
determine the recommended size.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-l</tt> option writes an informational line to
the system log each time <span class="application">bogofilter</span> is run.
The information logged depends on how
<span class="application">bogofilter</span> is run.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-L <i class="replaceable"><tt>tag</tt></i></tt> option
configures a tag which can be included in the information being logged
by the <tt class="option">-l</tt> option, but it requires a custom format
that includes the %l string for now.  This option implies
<tt class="option">-l</tt>.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-I <i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i></tt>
option tells <span class="application">bogofilter</span> to read its input
from the specified file, rather than from
<tt class="option">stdin</tt>.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-O <i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i></tt> option
tells <span class="application">bogofilter</span> where to write its output in
passthrough mode.  Note that this only works when -p is explicitly given.</p><p>PARAMETER OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-m
      <i class="replaceable"><tt>[<span class="optional">value</span>][<span class="optional">,value</span>][<span class="optional">,value</span>]</tt></i></tt>
      option allows setting the min_dev value and, optionally, the
      robs and robx values.  If one value is supplied, then min_dev is
      set.  If a comma followed by one value is supplied, then robs
      is set.  With two values, both min_dev and robs are set; with
      three, min_dev, robs and robx are set; and other combinations of
      values and commas behave as one would expect.  Note the
      syntax is misleading, at least one of the values MUST be present,
      and the commas determine what value(s) will be set.  Note: spaces
      are not allowed after the comma.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-o
      <i class="replaceable"><tt>[<span class="optional">value</span>][<span class="optional">,value</span>]</tt></i></tt>
      option allows setting the spam_cutoff value and, optionally, the
      ham_cutoff value.  If one value is supplied, then spam_cutoff is
      set.  If a comma followed by one value is supplied, then ham_cutoff
      is set.  With two values, both spam_cutoff and ham_cutoff are set.  Note the
      syntax is misleading, at least one of the values MUST be present,
      and the comma determines whether it is to set the spam or the ham
      cutoff.  Note: spaces are not allowed after the comma.</p><p>INFO OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">-v</tt> option produces a report to standard
output on <span class="application">bogofilter</span>'s analysis of the
input.  Each additional <tt class="option">v</tt> will increase the verbosity of
the output, up to a maximum of 4.  With <tt class="option">-vv</tt>, the report
lists the tokens with highest deviation from a mean of 0.5 association
with spam.</p><p>Option <tt class="option">-y date</tt> can be used to override the
current date when timestamping tokens.  A value of zero (0) turns off
timestamping.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-D</tt> option redirects debug output to stdout.</p><p>The <tt class="option">-x <i class="replaceable"><tt>flags</tt></i></tt> option
allows setting of debug flags for printing debug information.  See
header file debug.h for the list of usable flags.</p><p>CONFIG FILE OPTIONS</p><p>The <tt class="option">--<i class="replaceable"><tt>option=value</tt></i></tt>
option allows use of config file options on the command line.  See
<tt class="filename">bogofilter.cf.example</tt> for more info on the
available options.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="environment"></a><h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2><p>Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in the
