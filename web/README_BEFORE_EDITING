All files in this directory are rcs controlled. Use "co -l" to check files
out before editing, and "ci -u" to check them back in when you are done.

Note there is a hidden .htaccess file!

As to the "Permanent" Redirection: I (Matthias) have tried various way to
either send an Expires: or Cache-Control: public header, to use "Temporary
redirections" and allow for cacheable results, but all methods I am aware of
(mod_cern_meta, mod_expires) have failed. So we use Permanent, which is
cachable.
