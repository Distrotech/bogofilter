All files in this directory are cvs controlled.

To edit,

1. check out the web tree (replace LOGIN by your SourceForge user name)
   cvs -d :ext:LOGIN@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bogofilter \
	checkout -d bogofilter-web web

2. edit in bogofilter-web

3. commit the changes

4. log into the sourceforge net shell,
   type: ssh $user@shell.sourceforge.net
   then type: cd /home/groups/b/bo/bogofilter/web && ./updateweb

NOTE: you must also to #4 above if the FAQ or NEWS files have been
updated - we no longer use viewcvs to obtain these, it's all too slow.
