		bogofilter -- fast Bayesian spam filtering

This package implements a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested 
by Paul Graham in his article "A Plan For Spam".

This version substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing smarter
lexical analysis.  In particular, hostames and IP addresses are retained
as recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA 
cruft such as dates and message-IDs are discarded so as not to bloat
the word lists.

Note that the default location for the configuration files is
/etc on Linux and /usr/local/etc on all other systems, unless you
override with --sysconfdir=/etc

If you use mutt, see the bogofilter(1) manual page for helpful macros
you can add to your .muttrc.
