  <h2 id="what-is-bogofilter">What is bogofilter?</h2>

  <p>Bogofilter is a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested by Paul Graham in his article <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">A Plan For Spam</a>. Bogofilter uses <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101454/stories/2002/09/16/spamDetection.html">Gary Robinson</a>'s geometric-mean algorithm with the Fisher's method modification to classify email as spam or non-spam.</p>

  <p>The bogofilter <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net">home page</a> at SourceForge is the central clearinghouse for bogofilter resources.</p>

  <p>Bogofilter was started by Eric S. Raymond on August 19, 2002. It gained popularity in September 2002, and a number of other authors have started to contribute to the project.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/NEWS">NEWS file</a> describes bogofilter's version history.</p>

  <h2 id="vvv">What does bogofilter's verbose output mean?</h2>

  <p>Bogofilter can instructed to display information on the scoring of a message by running it with flags "-v", "-vv", "-vvv", or "-R".</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using "-v" causes bogofilter to generate the "X-Bogosity:" header line, i.e.
  <pre>
  X-Bogosity: No, tests=bogofilter, spamicity=0.500000
  </pre>
  </li>

  <li>Using "-vv" causes bogofilter to generate a histogram, i.e.
  <pre>
  X-Bogosity: No, tests=bogofilter, spamicity=0.500000
	  int  cnt    prob   spamicity  histogram
	 0.00   29  0.000209  0.000052  #############################
	 0.10    2  0.179065  0.003425  ##
	 0.20    2  0.276880  0.008870  ##
	 0.30   18  0.363295  0.069245  ##################
	 0.40    0  0.000000  0.069245  
	 0.50    0  0.000000  0.069245  
	 0.60   37  0.667823  0.257307  #####################################
	 0.70    5  0.767436  0.278892  #####
	 0.80   13  0.836789  0.334980  #############
	 0.90   32  0.984903  0.499835  ################################
  </pre>
<p>Each row shows an interval, the count of tokens with scores in that interval, the average spam probability for those tokens, the message's spamicity score (for those tokens and all lesser valued tokens), and a bar graph corresponding to the token count.</p>
<p>In the above histogram there are a lot of low scoring tokens and a lot of high scoring tokens.  They "balance" one another to give the spamicity score of 0.5000
</li>
<li>Using "-vvv" produces a list of <em>all</em> the tokens in the messages with information on each one, i.e.

  <pre>
  X-Bogosity: No, tests=bogofilter, spamicity=0.500000
			n    pgood     pbad      fw     U
  "which"              10  0.208333  0.000000  0.000041 +

			   1.00e-03  4.15e-01  0.100
  </pre>
The columns printed contain the following information:
  <dl>
    <dt>&quot;&hellip;&quot;<dd>the token in question
    <dt>n<dd>number of times this token was encountered in training
    <dt>pgood<dd>likelihood that a message containing this token is non-spam
    <dt>pbad<dd>likelihood that a message containing this token is spam
    <dt>fw<dd>Robinson's weighted index, which combines pgood and pbad to give a value that will be close to zero if a message containing this token is likely to be non-spam and close to one if it's likely to be spam
    <dt>U<dd>'<b>+</b>' if this token contributes to the final bogosity value, '<b>-</b>' otherwise.  A token is excluded when its score is closer to 0.5 than min_dev.
  </dl>
<p>The final lines show:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cumulative results of the columns</li>
    <li>The values of Robinson's <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> parameters and of <b>min_dev</b></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Using "-R" produces the "-vvv" output described above plus two additional columns:
  <dl>
    <dt>invfwlog<dd>logarithm of fw
    <dt>fwlog<dd>logarithm of (1-fw)
  </dl>
<p>
The "-R" output is formatted for use with the R language for statistical computing.  More information is available at <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">

</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="spamassassin">How can I use SpamAssassin to train Bogofilter?</h2>

<p>If you have a working SpamAssassin installation (or care to create one), you can use its return codes to train bogofilter.  
The easiest way is to create a script for your MDA that runs SpamAssassin, tests the spam/non-spam return code, and runs bogofilter to register the message as spam (or non-spam).  
The sample procmail recipe below shows one way to do this:<p>
 
  <pre>
  BOGOFILTER     = "/usr/bin/bogofilter"
  BOGOFILTER_DIR = "training"
  SPAMASSASSIN  = "/usr/bin/spamassassin"

  :0
  * ? $SPAMASSASSIN -e
  #spam yields non-zero
  #non-spam yields zero
  :0c
  | $BOGOFILTER -n -d $BOGOFILTER_DIR
  #else (E)
  :0Ec
  | $BOGOFILTER -s -d $BOGOFILTER_DIR

  :0fw
  | $BOGOFILTER -p -e

  :0:
  * ^X-Bogosity:.Yes
  spam

  :0:
  * ^X-Bogosity:.No
  non-spam
  </pre>

  <h2 id="asian-spam">What can I do about asian spam?</h2>

  <p>Many people get unsolicited email using asian language charsets.  Since they don't know the languages and don't know people there, they assume it's spam.</p>
<p>The good news is that bogofilter does detect them quite successfully. The bad news is that this can be expensive. You have basically two choices:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>You can simply let bogofilter handle it. Just train bogofilter with the asian language messages identified as spam. Bogofilter will parse the messages as best it can and will add tokens to the spam wordlist. The wordlist will contain many tokens which don't make sense to you (since the charset cannot be displayed), but bogofilter can work with them and successfully identify asian spam.</p>
      <p>A second method is to use the "replace_nonascii_characters" config file option. This will replace high-bit characters, i.e. those between 0x80 and 0xFF, with question marks, '?'. This keeps the database much smaller. Unfortunately this conflicts with european language which have many accented vowels and consonant in the high-bit range.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you are sure you will not receive any legitimate messages in those languages, you can kill them right away. This will keep the database smaller. You can do this with an MDA script.</p>
      <p>Here's a procmail recipe that will sideline messages written with asian charsets:</p>
<pre>
## Silently drop all asian language mail
UNREADABLE="big5|iso-2022-|euc-|gb2312|ks_c_5601-1987"
:0:
* 1^0 $ ^Subject:.*=\?($UNREADABLE)
* 1^0 $ ^Content-Type:.*charset=.*($UNREADABLE)
spam-unreadable

:0:
* ^Content-Type:.*multipart
* B ?? $ ^Content-Type:.*^?.*charset=.*($UNREADABLE)
spam-unreadable
</pre>
      <p>With the above recipe, bogofilter will <em>never</em> see the message.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="query-database">How do I manually query the database</h2>

  <p>To find the spam and ham counts for a token (word) use bogoutil's '-w' option. For example, "bogoutil -d $BOGOFILTER_DIR example.com" gives the good and bad counts for "example.com".</p>

  <p>To find out how many messages are in your wordlists query the special token .MSG_COUNT, i.e., run command "bogoutil -w $BOGOFILTER_DIR .MSG_COUNT" to see the counts for the spam and ham wordlists.</p>

  <p>To tell how many tokens are in your wordlists pipe the output of bogoutil's dump command to command "wc", i.e. use "bogoutil -d $BOGOFILTER_DIR/spamlist.db | wc -l " to display the count for the spamlist and use "bogoutil -d $BOGOFILTER_DIR/goodlist.db | wc -l" to display the count for the goodlist.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="rescue">How can I tell if my wordlists are corrupted?</h2>

  <p>If you think your wordlists are hosed, you can see what BerkeleyDB thinks by running:</p>
<pre>
db_verify spamlist.db
db_verify goodlist.db
</pre>

  <p>If there is a problem, you may be able to recover some (or all) of the tokens and their counts with the following commands:</p>
<pre>
bogoutil -d spamlist.db | bogoutil -l spamlist.db.new
</pre>

  <p>or with</p>
<pre>
db_dump -r spamlist.db &gt; spamlist.txt
db_load spamlist.new &lt; spamlist.txt
</pre>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="port-notes">How do I get bogofilter working on Solaris, BSD, etc?</h2>

  <p>If you don't already have a v3.0+ version of <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">BerkeleyDB</a>, then <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html">download it</a>, unpack it, and do these commands in the 'dist' directory:</p>
<pre>
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

  <p>Next, download a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62265">portable version</a> of bogofilter.</p>

  <p class="subheading">On Solaris</p>

  <p>Unpack it, and then do:</p>
<pre>
$ ./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.0
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

  <p>You will either want to put a symlink to libdb.so in /usr/lib, or use a modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before you start bogofilter.</p>
<pre>
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.0
</pre>

  <p class="subheading">On FreeBSD</p>

  <p>Unpack it, and do:</p>
<pre>
$ ./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.0
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ ldconfig /usr/lib /usr/local/lib \
/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.0/lib
</pre>

  <p>The 'ldconfig' command gives the runtime linker a way to find the new libraries. Be careful not to clobber other paths you may have added using ldconfig.</p>

  <p class="subheading">On HP-UX</p>

  <p>See the file README.hp-ux in the source distribution.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="nfs">Can I share wordlists over NFS?</h2>

  <p>Yes, provided you use the correct file locking to avoid data corruption. When you compile bogofilter, you will need to verify that the configure script has set "#define HAVE_FCNTL 1" in your config.h file. Popular UNIX operating systems will all support this. If you are running an unusual, or an older version of an operating system, make sure it supports fcntl(). If "#define HAVE_FCNTL 1" is set, then comment out "#define HAVE_FLOCK 1" so that the locking system uses fcntl() locking instead of the default of flock() locking. If your system does not support fcntl, then you will not be able to share wordlist files over NFS without the risk of data corruption.</p>

  <p>Next, make sure you have NFS set up properly, with "lockd" running. Refer to your NFS documentation for more information about running "lockd" or "rpc.lockd". Most operating systems with NFS turn this on by default.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="return-codes">Why does bogofilter give return codes like 0 and 256 when it's run from inside a program?</h2>

  <p>Likely the return codes are being reformatted by waitpid(2). Use WEXITSTATUS(status) in sys/wait.h, or comparable macro, to get the correct value.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="changed-options">Now that I've upgraded to 0.11 why are my scripts broken?</h2>

  <p>With version 0.11 bogofilter's options for registering mail as ham or spam have been changed. They now allow registering (or unregistering) messages in the ham and spam wordlists. Prior to this, there was no way to unregister a message from a wordlist (without registering it in the other wordlist).</p>

  <p>Bogofilter has four registration options - '-s', '-n', '-S', and '-N'. With the release of version 0.11 the meaning of '-S' and '-N' has been changed to allow unregistering messages from the word lists. Here's what the four options mean:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>-s<dd>means to register the current message as spam, i.e. add its tokens to spamlist.db
    <dt>-n<dd>means to register the current message as ham, i.e. add its tokens to goodlist.db
    <dt>-S<dd>means to unregister the current message from the spam wordlist, i.e. remove its tokens from spamlist.db
    <dt>-N<dd>means to unregister the current message from the ham wordlist, i.e. remove its tokens from goodlist.db
  </dl>

  <p>Prior to version 0.11, the '-S' option was used to move a message from the ham wordlist to the spam wordlist, i.e. there were two actions. Now with 0.11 each of the two actions is invoked by its own option. To get the same effect as the old '-S', you should use '-N -s' (or '-Ns' which means the same thing).</p>

  <p>Similarly, the old '-N' option is now '-Sn' (or '-S -n').</p>

  <p>MUA scripts typically use '-s' and '-n' and don't need to change. Other scripts which use '-S' and '-N' for fixing registration errors <em>do</em> need to be changed.</p>
