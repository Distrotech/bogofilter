NOTE: Please also see the CHANGES-0.14 document for a detailed summary.

With release 0.14, bogofilter's use of BerkelyDB has changed.  First,
TrivialDB (tdb) can be used.  Second, instead of separate wordlists
for spam and ham tokens, bogofilter can now use a single combined,
wordlist that stores both all tokens.  In the combined wordlist each
token contains two counts - for spam and ham.  The name of the new
file is wordlist.db.

Bogofilter will check in $BOGOFILTER_DIR and use the wordlist(s) that
are there.  If wordlist.db is present, bogofilter will use the
combined mode.  If wordlist.db is not present, but both spamlist.db
and goodlist.db are present, bogofilter will use the separate wordlist
mode.  If no wordlists are present, bogofilter will create wordlist.db
and use it.

Command line switches '-W' and '-WW' can be used to tell bogofilter
the mode you want.  Also config file options "wordlist_mode=combined"
and "wordlist_mode=separate" can be used.
