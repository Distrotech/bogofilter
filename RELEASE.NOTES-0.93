INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN BOGOFILTER 0.93
=======================================

I1. Defaults changed

Bogofilter's defaults have been changed.  It now operates in tri-state
mode and will classify messages as Spam, Ham, or Unsure.

If you're checking messages for "X-Bogosity: Yes" or "X-Bogosity: No",
you _need_ to change your checks.  Use "X-Bogosity: Spam" and
"X-Bogosity: Ham" instead of the old forms.  Also, checking for
"X-Bogosity: Unsure" and putting those messages in a separate folder
(or mailbox) will give you an excellent set of messages for training,
as "Unsure" messages are messages that bogofilter has too little
information to classify (with certainty) as spam or ham.


MAJOR CHANGES IN BOGOFILTER 0.93
================================

M1. Berkeley DB switched to Transactional Data Store

Bogofilter will now use the Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store when
compiled with Berkeley DB as the data base engine (the default).

This means that bogofilter programs now exhibit the A C I D traits,
changes are atomic (all-or-nothing), the data base is always consistent,
changes are always isolated from each other and all changes that are
acknowledged are durable.

Bogofilter can stand multiple writers at the same time, mixed freely
with simultaneous readers, and the data base will not get corrupt in
application or system crashes, except when the disk drive gets damaged.

Note that this requires that the operating system and disk drive
maintain proper write order on the disk, and that both be honest about
synchronous I/O completion.

Note also that this causes bogofilter to write additional "log" files to
its .bogofilter (or other home) directory that need to be archived or
deleted periodically.

For detailed instructions, be sure to check doc/README.db and check the
BerkeleyDB documentation.
