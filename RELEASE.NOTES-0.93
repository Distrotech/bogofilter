Bogofilter's defaults have been changed.  It now operates in tri-state
mode and will classify messages as Spam, Ham, or Unsure.

If you're checking messages for "X-Bogosity: Yes" or "X-Bogosity: No",
you _need_ to change your checks.  Use "X-Bogosity: Spam" and
"X-Bogosity: Ham" instead of the old forms.  Also, checking for
"X-Bogosity: Unsure" and putting those messages in a separate folder
(or mailbox) will give you an excellent set of messages for training,
as "Unsure" messages are messages that bogofilter has too little
information to classify (with certainty) as spam or ham.
