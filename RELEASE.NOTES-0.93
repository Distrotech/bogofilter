               INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN BOGOFILTER 0.93
               =======================================


Defaults changed
----------------

Bogofilter's defaults have been changed.  It now operates in tri-state
mode and will classify messages as Spam, Ham, or Unsure.

If you're checking messages for "X-Bogosity: Yes" or "X-Bogosity: No",
you _need_ to change your checks.  Use "X-Bogosity: Spam" and
"X-Bogosity: Ham" instead of the old forms.  Also, checking for
"X-Bogosity: Unsure" and putting those messages in a separate folder
(or mailbox) will give you an excellent set of messages for training,
as "Unsure" messages are messages that bogofilter has too little
information to classify (with certainty) as spam or ham.



                   MAJOR CHANGES IN BOGOFILTER 0.93
                   ================================


Berkeley DB switched to Transactional Data Store
------------------------------------------------

Bogofilter will now use the Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store when
compiled with Berkeley DB as the data base engine (the default).

This means that bogofilter programs now exhibit the A C I D traits:
changes are atomic (all-or-nothing); the data base is always consistent;
changes are always isolated from each other; and all changes that are
acknowledged are durable.

Bogofilter can support multiple writers at the same time, mixed freely
with simultaneous readers, and the data base will not be corrupted by
application or system crashes, except when the disk drive gets damaged.

Note that this requires that the operating system and disk drive
maintain proper write order on the disk, and that both be honest about
synchronous I/O completion.

Note also that this causes bogofilter to write additional "log" files
to its ~/.bogofilter (or other) home directory.  The log files need to
be archived or deleted periodically.

For detailed instructions, be sure to _read_ doc/README.db and check the
BerkeleyDB documentation.

These benefits are not available when bogofilter is compiled to use the
TDB or QDBM data bases.

QDBM database format changed to B+ trees
----------------------------------------

The QDBM database format has been changed from hash tables to B+
trees, i.e. from the DEPOT API to the Villa API.  This results in
significantly better performance, i.e. faster speed.  Unfortunately,
the two modes are incompatible, so upgrading to 0.9.3 requires several
special steps, i.e. dumping and renaming your wordlist before
installing 0.93 and building a new wordlist afterwards.

Use these commands:

1:  bogoutil -d /your/path/wordlist.db > wordlist.txt
2:  mv /your/path/wordlist.db /your/path/wordlist.db.old
3:  install new bogofilter
4:  bogoutil -l /your/path/wordlist.db < wordlist.txt

                  --- END of RELEASE.NOTES-0.93 ---
