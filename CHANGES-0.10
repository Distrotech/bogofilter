0.10.1.1 2003-01-22
	* Fixed two problems in parsing html.

0.10.1  2003-01-22
	* Added convenience options '-2' and '-3' to set binary/ternary
	  modes when using Robinson-Fisher classification.

	2003-01-21
	* Fixed problems in configure script.  Bogofilter now builds correctly
	  with any combination of the three classification algorithms.

	2003-01-20
	* Bogofilter now kills html comments.  The '-k' switch can be used
	  to change the behavior.
	* Fixed spamicity computation problem when using graham wordlist and 
	  robinson or robinson-fisher algorithm.
	* Fixed problem processing mime boundaries which caused an incorrect
	  message count when processing a mailbox

0.10.0  2003-01-19
	* Reworked database code to correct locking and database
	  corruption issues
	* Reworked database API to so bogoutil needn't know internal
	  API for database.
	
	2003-01-12
	* Merged mime processing code into main cvs branch.
	* Moved most documentation files to doc directory.
	* Renamed regression t.systest.d to bogofilter.
	
	2002-12-31
	* Added sample procmail file, contrib/procmailrc.example
	
	2002-12-30
	* Spamicity score now computed from multiple word list pairs, i.e. all
	  spam and ham word lists in directories named on command line or in
	  config file (via "wordlist=" lines).

	2002-12-28
	* Added mime processing capability, with decoding of base64,
	  quoted-printable and uuencoded sections.  Ignores attachments when
	  computing spamicity.
	* lexer is now case insensitive

	2002-12-24
	* Cleaned up code for specifying wordlist directory(s).

	2002-12-15
	* Added dates to wordlist tokens.  Option "datestamp_tokens=true|false"
	  can be used to enable/disable them.
	* Added wordlist maintenance capability to bogoutil.  Can discard
	  tokens based on count, age, or length.  Can replace non-ASCII with
	  question marks.

	2002-12-08
	* Increase MAXTOKENLEN from 20 to 30, allowing more and longer tokens
	  to be processed.

	2002-12-07
	* Using new character set handling routines to provide charset specific
	  token parsing.
	* Added new config file options for setting of default charset and
	  replacing of non-ASCII characters.
	* New error handling routine will output error messages to stderr and,
	  if '-l' (logging) is enabled, to syslog.
	* Work around ash-0.2 and bash-1 bugs, needed for make check.
	* Reorder gcc __attribute__ lines for gcc-2.7 compatibility.
	* Cater for malloc/calloc implementations that return NULL when 0 bytes
	  of memory are requested, some AIX versions e. g., that would
	  previously falsely claim an "out of memory" condition.

	* New message formatting capability allows formats to be put in config
	  file for X-Bogosity line and logging messages.  Message content can
	  include status, spamicity, version, etc.
