# How to debug the lexer

The most effective way seems to be adding "debug" to the "%option" line,
compile "bogolexer" and run that against a small set of words. The
"debug" option will make the generated lexer output what rules it
accepts (with lexer.l line numbers).  If bogolexer does not print a
get_token line, then the lexer has not returned the value TOKEN, but
ignored the token.

IMPORTANT: Remember to remove the debug %option before committing any
changes!
