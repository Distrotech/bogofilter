0.11.0

    Command line flags
	
	The meaning of command line flags '-S' and '-N' was changed in
	version 0.11.0.  Previously '-S' meant to unregister a message
	from the spam wordlist and register the message in the
	non-spam wordlist and '-N' meant to unregister from non-spam
	and register as spam.

	Each of the flags now performs a single action.  
	'-S' unregisters a message from the spam wordlist and 
	'-N' unregisters a message from the non-spam wordlist.

	To duplicate the old (compound) actions, it is necessary to
	use two options - an unregister option ('-S' or '-N') and a
	register option ('-s' or '-n').

	To duplicate the effect of the old '-S' option, use '-N -s'.
	To duplicate the effect of the old '-N' option, use '-S -n'.
	The order of the options doesn't matter and they can be
	concatenated, as in '-Sn' and '-sN'.

   Config file processing

	The code to process config files now checks numeric values
	for validity.  It complains when it detects something
	wrong.  In particular, double precision values are no longer
	allowed to have a terminal 'f'.  For example
	"spam_cutoff=0.95f" will generate a messages.

    New parameter query option

	Using options "-q -v" in a bogofilter command line will run
	the query_config() function and will display bogofilter's
	various parameter values.  This can be very useful in finding
	the reason for an unexpected message classification.
