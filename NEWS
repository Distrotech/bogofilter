-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2006-07-03

	* Clean up token prefixing.
	* Clean up queue-id processing.
	* Add max-multi-token-len checks.
	* Revised function names.  get_token() uses parse_new_token(),
          add_token_to_array(), build_token_from_array(), and
          build_prefixed_token(). 

	2006-07-02

	* Add min-token-len check (with exemption for 2 character
          money amounts which bogofilter has long accepted).
	* Add "short token" pattern to lexer

	2006-07-01

	* Refactor get_token.  Function get_single_token is the original
          get_token function.  Function get_multi_token calls
          get_single_token when another token must be parsed, else it
          constructs multi-part tokens using w_token_array (an array
          of word_t structs).

	2006-06-20

	* Add options for min/max token length, multi-token count, and
          max multi-token length.

	* Modify get_token() to return multi-word tokens.

	2006-06-02

	* "make rpm" changes:
	  - document use with gpg-agent (see Makefile.am)
	  - build static RPMs (these won't fail) before shared RPMs

	2006-05-29

	* #include cleanups in common.h, system.h and C files.

	2006-04-28

	* Updated copyright dates.

	2006-04-13

	* Included additional config file options in bogofilter's
	  --help message.

	2006-03-27

	* Corrected option parsing in bogotune to support -n ham1 ham2
	  -s spam1 spam2 as suggested by bogotune -h; broken since 0.93.2.

	2006-03-26

	* Corrected problem with bogotune's -D option (thanks to Jason Smith).

	* Corrected man page description of bogotune's -n and -s options.

	2006-03-17

	* Fixed bf_compact's test for transactional environment.

	2006-03-12

	* 1.0.2 Promoted to "Stable" status

1.0.2	2006-03-03

	2006-02-19

	* Added vm-bogofilter.el for using bogofilter with VM, an
          Emacs mail tool (thanks to Bj√∂rn Knutsson).
	* Added FAQ question "How do I use bogofilter with VM (an
          Emacs mail tool)?" (thanks to Pimpon).

	2006-02-14

	* SleepyCat has been acquired by Oracle, who are now providing
	  Berkeley DB. Since most of the references are to actual
	  strings in the programs or addresses that remain unchanged,
	  this will only gradually show in the bogofilter sources and
	  documentation.

	2006-02-06

	* Flush output after writing spam header line and/or message body.
	* When database is near to maximum allowed size, allow reading
	  it and disallow writing to it.

	2006-01-30

	* Fix formatting of Rtable output when in the message header,
	  this keeps verbose passthrough modes RFC-822/2822 compliant.

	2006-01-29

	* The configure script, when checking Berkeley DB capabilities,
	  now checks for logging and transactional subsystems rather
	  than the locking subsystem that was abandoned before 1.0.0.
	  This appears a suitable workaround for configure lockups on
	  OpenBSD 3.7 macppc with db 4.2 or 4.3.

	2006-01-28

	* Only print Berkeley DB file size message once per run.

	2006-01-21

	* 1.0.1 Promoted to "Stable" status

	2006-01-02

	* Fixed --input-file and --output-file command line options.

	2006-01-01

	* Added CVE-2005 identifiers for defects described in
          doc/bogofilter-SA-2005-01

1.0.1	2006-01-01

	* New names for binary rpms:

	  bogofilter-db42 - requires shared library for DB-4.2.52
	  bogofilter-db42-static - statically linked with DB-4.2.52
	  bogofilter-sqlite3 - requires shared library for SQLite3-3.2.8
	  bogofilter-sqlite3-static - statically linked with SQLite3-3.2.8

	2005-12-30

	* The configure help texts have been revised, the IEEE checks
	  for trio have been simplified (they are no longer nested) and
	  configure.ac has been updated to quiet autoconf -Wobsolete
	  warnings. The README file now reflects the new requirements.

	2005-12-29

	* For maintainers: Add install-staticdblibs.sh, a script to
	  fetch and build static & lean BerkeleyDB 4.2.52.4 and SQLite
	  3.2.8 libraries. Modify some parts of the RPM building so that
	  the binary RPMs are built without external dependencies beyond
	  glibc 2.2. This may render "make rpm" unusable on non-Linux
	  platforms, but you should still be able to "rpmbuild -tb" from
	  the source .tar.gz file.

	2005-12-27

	* Add '-O' option to direct bogoutil output to a file.
	* Fix building of binary rpms with SQLite support.
	* Include SQLite binary rpm as standard part of "make rpm"

	2005-12-26

	* Split NEWS file into files NEWS and NEWS.0 for new (version
	  1.0 and after) and old (version 0.x.y) info

	2005-12-25

	* Capitalize variables in bogofilter.spec.in to please RH9's
          RPM 4.2 implementation.

	2005-12-18
	
	* Fix bad return code in db_loop() in datastore_sqlite.c
	  (reported by Sami Farin).

	2005-12-17
	
	* XML documentation cleanups (thanks to Nicholas Kaiser).

	2005-12-06

	* bogofilter.cf.example was updated to reflect the proper default of
	  db_log_autoremove=yes. It previously claimed the default were "off".

1.0.0	2005-11-30

	Release history prior to 1.0.0 is in file NEWS.0
