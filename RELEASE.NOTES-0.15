*** GOOD NEWS ... BAD NEWS ***

Since release 0.15.9, bogofilter no longer allows to disable algorithms,
which has never been supported well.

With release 0.15.4, all header line tokens are now tagged as:

    Subject:      subj:
    To:           to:
    From:         from:
    Return-Path:  rtrn:
    Received:     rcvd:   ***new***
    any other:    head:   ***new***

Since existing wordlists don't have "head:???" tokens, the new tokens
won't be found in the wordlist and bogofilter's accuracy will go down.
To correct this you can do one of the following things:

1 - Use the new "-H" (for header-degen) option when scoring messages.
This option tells bogofilter to check the wordlist twice for each
header token - once for "head:xyz" and a second time for "xyz".  The
ham and spam counts are added together to give a cumulative result.

Note that, with bogofilter 0.15.4 and later, during message
registration, "head:xyz" tokens are added to the wordlist (for the
header lines).  The "-H" option is only applied during scoring.

The "-H" option is meant for temporary usage to cover the period while
bogofilter goes from having no "head:xyz" tokens in the wordlist to
the time when there are enough such tokens to score messages
effectively.  After a few weeks, or perhaps months, of registering
messages with the new bogofilter, use of the "-H" option can end and
bogofilter will use the newly added "head:xyz" tokens.

2 - Retrain bogofilter with whatever ham and spam you have available.
This will create "header:xyz" tokens and allow the new, more effective
header tagging to be used to fullest advantage.

*** A MAJOR ENHANCEMENT ***

With release 0.15, bogofilter's code for processing multiple messages
has been rewritten.  In addition to understanding mbox format files,
bogofilter now understands maildirs and MH folders.
