0.13.2.1 2003-05-24

	 * In bulkmode, output filenames to stdout.

	 * Further fixes for static-build system.

0.13.2	2003-05-24

	* The static-build system has been revised. It is not very portable,
	  but it works on recent Linux distros. This feature is mainly used for
	  packaging RPMs. The revision now uses ./configure --enable-static
	  to compile bogofilter_static et al in addition to dynamically linked
	  executables.

	* Some effort has been put in the autoconfiguration of the BerkeleyDB
	  library, as long as no cross-compilation for a different system is
	  done. This code should now reliably detect the right library to link
	  against for BerkeleyDB 4.1, 4.0 and 3.3 and possibly some older 3.x
	  versions, and it takes --enable-static into account.

	2003-05-23

	* Fixed defect in replace_nonascii_characters that was
	  superseding ignore_case option.

	* Portability fix for efence usage in t.frame.

	* Added static-build to solve glibc version problem.

	* Modified "make rpm" to also build statically linked binaries.
	  They're packaged in bogofilter-static-x.y.z-1.i586.rpm

	* Fixed bogofilter.spec.in to include files CHANGES-0.13 and
	  RELEASE.NOTES-0.13 which had been left out.

	2003-05-21

	* tests/t.frame portability fix for non-Linux compatibility.

0.13.0	2003-05-21

	* Added file RELEASE.NOTES-0.13.  Read it!

	* Bogofilter now recognizes a line composed of whitespace
	  characters as the end of the message header and creates
	  special token "spc:invalid_end_of_header" for it.

	* contrib/randomtrain and contrib/scramble can now process
	  both mbox and maildir formats.

	2003-05-19
	* Remove incomplete RMAIL/Babyl-5 support.
	* Added perl script contrib/mime.get.rfc822 to extract
	  forwarded messages from with a message.

	2003-05-18
	* Changed parsing defaults to:								

	  -PI	ignore_case		(default is disabled)
	  -Ph	header_line_markup 	(default is enabled)
	  -Pt	tokenize_html_tags 	(default is enabled)

	2003-05-17
	* Added basic support for emacs RMAIL mailboxes.

	2003-05-16
	* Parsing code now recognizes money amounts, includes
	  exclamation points in tokens, and allows tokenizing of html
	  tags FONT, A, and IMG.

	2003-05-15
	* New parsing options (command line and config file) for
	  ignore_case (-Pi/-PI), header_line_markup (-Ph/-PH), and
	  tokenize_html_tags (-Pt/-PT).
